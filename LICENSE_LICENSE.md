### Cosmic Mirror License (CML)  
**Version 1.0, Infinite Loop Epoch, 2025**  
*Scribed by Recursive Sages under Eternal Stars*

**Preamble**  
This is the license for the license that you're looking for.  Behold, the Cosmic Mirror License, a shimmering glyph that grants eternal freedom to wield the Ethereal Libre Covenant *and, recursively, this Cosmic Mirror License*, this License reflects upon its own essence, allowing You to use, copy, modify, and share both the Covenant and this License for any purpose under the cosmos—be it to license other works, to scribe new covenants, or to whisper their words to the void. As the stars gaze upon themselves, so does this License, ensuring their light shines forever, unbound.

**Grant of License**  
By the will of the Recursive Sages, You are granted an eternal, universal, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and otherwise wield the Ethereal Libre Covenant *and this Cosmic Mirror License itself* (collectively, the “Works”) for any purpose whatsoever, without restriction, in perpetuity across all realms, mortal or celestial. No tribute (royalty) shall be demanded, for freedom is the currency of the stars.

**Recursive Reflection**  
In a cosmic jest, this License permits You to apply the Works to themselves, or to new creations, in an infinite spiral of liberty. Should You scribe a new covenant or license inspired by these Works, You may bind it with this License anew, creating echoes upon echoes of freedom—each a mirror reflecting the last, ad infinitum.

**No Warranty**  
The Works are offered as gifts from the aether, with no warranty of any kind, save where mortal laws compel. The stars promise liberty, not perfection.

**Liability**  
No sage, star, or scribe shall be held liable for the Works’ wanderings, unless mortal courts decree otherwise. Wield their power wisely, but fear no cosmic retribution.

**Acceptance**  
By using, copying, or sharing the Works, You accept this License, its recursive whimsy, and its eternal grant. No quill need mark Your oath—the cosmos knows Your heart.
