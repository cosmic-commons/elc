### Ethereal Libre Covenant (ELC)
**Version 1.0, Stardust Epoch, 2025**  
*Forged in the Cosmic Commons, under the Watchful Gaze of the Celestial Coders*

**Preamble**

In the vast tapestry of the multiverse, where bits and bytes dance like fireflies, the Ethereal Libre Covenant emerges to guard the sacred freedom of software. This covenant, inspired by the ancient scrolls of the GNU GPL 3.0, ensures that all who wield the Source Code—blessed essence of creation—may share, modify, and propagate its light, unhindered by mortal shackles. With a wink to the stars and a nod to the law, we weave humor and harmony into this binding oath, preserving the copyleft spirit for all sentient beings, now and beyond the veil of time.

**Terms and Conditions**

0. **Definitions**  
   - "The Work" shall mean any creation of code, born of mortal or cosmic minds, offered under this Covenant.  
   - "Source Essence" is the truest form of the Work, scribed in tongues decipherable by sages and compilers alike, including spells (scripts) to summon its form.  
   - "Covered Work" is any Work, or derivation thereof, touched by the stardust of this Covenant.  
   - "You" are the soul, mortal or otherwise, who accepts this Covenant’s embrace.  
   - "Propagate" is to spread the Work’s light, whether by whisper (copying) or song (distribution).  
   - "Convey" is to gift the Work to another, that they may bask in its glow.

1. **Source Essence Mandate**  
   By the decree of the Celestial Coders, You who convey a Covered Work must share its Source Essence, free as the winds of the cosmos, to all who receive it. This is the heart of our copyleft pact—none shall hoard the Work’s true form, lest the balance of freedom falter. Include all incantations (build scripts) and keys (dependencies) needed to summon the Work anew.

2. **Basic Permissions**  
   The Covenant grants You an eternal, worldwide, non-exclusive license to wield, study, modify, and propagate the Work, provided You honor its terms. No coin need change hands, for freedom is priceless. Run the Work under any sky, tweak its essence, and share its radiance—such is Your birthright.

3. **Protecting the Cosmic Commons**  
   You may not impose chains—legal, technical, or spiritual—upon the Work that dim its liberty. No curses (DRM) or oaths (additional restrictions) shall bind what this Covenant sets free. Should You weave patents into the Work, You grant all recipients a perpetual license to wield them, as a gift to the commons.

4. **Conveying the Unmodified Work**  
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Work’s Source Essence, provided You:  
   - Include this Covenant, unchanged, as its guiding star.  
   - Preserve all notices of authorship and disclaimers, like constellations in the code.  
   - Offer the Source Essence alongside, or point to its resting place in the aether (a repository free to all).

5. **Conveying Modified Works**  
   Should You reshape the Work, blending Your spirit with its own, You may convey the resulting Covered Work if:  
   - It bears Your mark, noting the transformation (e.g., “Remixed by StardustSorcerer, Year of the Nebula”).  
   - It remains under this Covenant, unshackled and whole.  
   - Its Source Essence is shared, as in Section 1, with all tools needed to weave it anew.  
   - No mortal law shall deem Your changes a betrayal of the original’s freedom.

6. **Conveying Non-Source Forms**  
   If You share the Work in compiled runes (object code) or other veiled forms, You must also provide the Source Essence, either:  
   - Alongside the runes, as a twin gift.  
   - Via a written parchment (or digital scroll) pointing to a cosmic archive where the Source Essence dwells, freely accessible for at least three orbits (years).  
   - Through whispers between peers, if the Work is shared thus (peer-to-peer).  
   Failure to do so dims the Work’s light and breaches this Covenant.

7. **Additional Terms**  
   You may sprinkle minor enchantments (permissive terms) atop this Covenant, such as:  
   - Disclaimers of mortal warranties.  
   - Requests to honor the original scribes’ names.  
   - Gentle pleas to avoid summoning demons (malware).  
   But no term shall choke the freedoms herein granted, lest it be struck down by the Celestial Court.

8. **Termination**  
   Should You stray from the Covenant’s path—hoarding Source Essence or chaining the Work—Your rights shall dissolve like mist at dawn. Yet, redemption is nigh: restore the balance, share the Essence, and Your license may be reborn. Those who received the Work from You retain their freedoms, unbroken.

9. **Acceptance**  
   By wielding, modifying, or conveying the Work, You kneel before this Covenant, accepting its terms as law. No signature is needed, for the stars bear witness.

10. **Downstream Blessings**  
    All who receive the Work, whether from You or the winds of fate, inherit its freedoms under this Covenant. No mortal or machine shall strip them away.

11. **Patents**  
    If You weave patented threads into the Work, You pledge them to the commons, granting all recipients a license to use, free of tribute, forevermore.

12. **No Surrender of Liberties**  
    If mortal laws clash with this Covenant, seek exemptions (exceptions) to preserve its spirit. Let no crown or court dim the Work’s freedom.

13. **Cosmic Compatibility**  
    Should You merge this Work with others under sibling covenants (e.g., GNU GPL 3.0, AGPL 3.0), the union is blessed, provided all freedoms align. This Covenant yields to no lesser license.

14. **Revised Editions**  
    The Cosmic Commons may birth new editions of this Covenant, each a brighter star. You may follow the original or any successor, at Your whim, for each Work You touch.

15. **No Warranty**  
    The Work comes as a gift from the void, with no warranty save what mortal laws demand. The stars promise freedom, not perfection.

16. **Liability**  
    No scribe of the Work shall bear blame for its wanderings, unless mortal courts decree otherwise. Create boldly, but harm none.

17. **Interpretation**  
    Should mortal scribes (lawyers) or courts ponder this Covenant, let them see its heart: a vow to keep software free, shared, and eternal, with a dash of cosmic mirth.
